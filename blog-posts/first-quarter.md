title: My First PhD Semester - What No One Talks About

## Why I'm writing this

Most of the blog posts I ever see about CS PhDs are from people documenting the application process, or
their advice on how to get a PhD, all of which are unique to the person and the institution they're attending.
During my first semester (actually, University of Washington does quarters, but using the term *semester* is just more understandable) I found great comfort in writing — it became a stabilizing practice, a way to reflect clearly and track progress. I tried to write about everything, the externals and internals of what was happening around me, in attempt to document the advice that I might use or relay in those moments when the emotional turmoil is too high and it's easy to forget clever hacks to just...survive. 

And I was right to do it. Over these three months, I’ve caught myself drifting into stress or irrational fears, and returning to my own words has helped me slow down, recalibrate, and strategize with more clarity. I want to share the observations and lessons I’ve gathered - some deeply personal, others more general — in the hope that they might help someone else feel seen, understood, and a little less alone. If even one person finds comfort, validation, or a practical strategy they can carry forward, then the writing will have done its job.

## The PhD, So Far — What's Shifted?

### Imposter syndrome on steroids

The biggest shift I felt right away was the sudden, exponential spike in imposter syndrome.
UW did something clever during orientation for the first-year PhD cohort: the very first slide they showed simply read “YOU BELONG HERE.” All caps. They spent a solid twenty minutes reminding us not to fall into the comparison trap, that we all arrived with different skill sets, that we were the 60-ish selected from a pool of more than 3,000 applicants. And yet, within weeks, most of us realized exactly why that was the first message they delivered the moment we walked through the university doors.

Starting with myself, I came in with plenty of preexisting insecurities. I’d never worked in industry, no internships, no exposure to tech jobs. I didn’t come from a “target school,” and suddenly I was surrounded by people from top-15 programs. I also don’t think of myself as a naturally talented programmer. I work very hard to understand the "easiest" things. When I was applying to grad programs, my undergrad advisor told me: 

> "In many CS grad programs, you have to be brilliant just to be average".

 What struck me was how my mind reacted to all of this. You’d think I would remind myself, “Hey, I started a PhD with twelve publications, which is a wild number for an undergrad.” But no. Instead, the thought that greeted me on day one was: 
 
 > “Alright. You’ve managed to weasel your way through so far. Now’s the moment they finally uncover that you’re a fraud.”

 I like to joke that my imposter syndrome is *imposterer*.

### The good, the bad, and the ugly

 The second, very unexpected shift I noticed was that a high-pressure environment brings everything to the surface — the good and the bad. And from what I’ve observed, most of that pressure is self-imposed. No one really knows what they’re doing, but we’re all used to being overachievers, so we overcompensate.

In that state — where you don’t quite know what progress should look like or what you’re “supposed” to be doing — your virtues and flaws appear under a magnifying glass. And I’m not exaggerating when I say *everything* comes out. All the insecurities I used to brush off, back when my life was full of structure, predictable tasks, and distractions? They've surfaced almost immediately.

I learned very quickly how ugly it can feel to hit the same wall fifteen times in a row, or to hesitate asking a question because I’m terrified that I should already know the answer. But in those difficult moments, I also saw existing good parts of myself slowly elevating. My resilience stretched to a new level and my composure improved compared to just a year before. I learned to reach out to my support system when I truly needed it and not use it as a crutch when I needed to be a big girl and stand on my own.

Fair warning: the stuff that comes out is not always work-related. It can be anything — the way you’ve handled conflict or relationships in the past, insecurities about your appearance, or old habits you thought you’d outgrown.

For example, my fear that I’m too self-centered and don’t invest enough in others magnified immediately. I also found myself slipping into tiny toxic rituals: punishing myself by withholding things that actually help me decompress whenever I felt I hadn’t “done enough” or had somehow wronged someone.

My bad eating habits caught up with me fast. I’ve always had this thing where I forget to eat or only do so when I feel physically hungry. It took about three weeks before that pattern made me nearly faint in the middle of a train station — that’s how rapidly things can escalate in this environment.
But some parts of me got stronger too. My discipline around exercise and sleep tightened almost instantly. I signed up for pilates classes so I’d feel accountable to show up, and I refuse to pull all-nighters for work. That’s a non-negotiable for me.

The point is this: I don’t think anyone is fully aware of the complexity of who they are until they’re pushed to face themselves. A high-pressure environment forces those parts to the surface — all of them — and you finally see what’s been hiding underneath.


### Guilt and shame

This is something that really messes with me— the feeling of everpresent guilt about not doing enough or making enough progress. It's really hard to define progress, especially in the first year of PhD. During one of our weekly meetings, I asked my advisors whether they felt we were making progress, because to me it seemed like we were just running in circles. They told me:

> “If the circle is the same every time, that’s no progress. But look closely at the circle. Is it a little rounder? A little more defined each time you move through it? That might be what progress looks like.”

Yet, that guilt is always somewhere in the back of my mind. I just came back from Thanksgiving break, not having done much work, and for valid reasons, but I still feel horrible about it. There is always something to do, something to learn, and (in my case) something to catch up on. So every moment I’m not working feels like a moment wasted, like I’m falling further behind in a race no one asked me to run.

I was also born and raised in Eastern Europe, so my mindset leans more towards "work to live" than "live to work". I will only ever put work above my life and family if that works brings me immense personal satisfaction and gives me a reason to believe I am contributing something meaningful to humanity. So, being in the US, a largely capitalist society, and surrounded with the so-called "founder culture" (lock in, grind, Linkedin influencers, "living-in-sf" shitposters), I've had to adjust my mindset to work with the environment, while maintaining my sanity. Still learning how to stay grounded while living inside a culture whose default setting is overwork.

That said, the guilt extends to the other side of the scale too. You essentially pause your long-term life plans for five years to get this degree. You might even have to move — like I did — across the country (again). There are certain future-plans-sacrifices I’ve had to make, like delaying having children, something I always imagined doing before 30. Not being able to be fully financially independent from my parents, even with a PhD stipend. Not being able to build meaningful savings with the love of my life.

None of these things affect my day-to-day life, but they *absolutely affect* the people around me. And while this isn’t *everyone’s* experience, I think it’s important to acknowledge it, because the emotional toll varies depending on how solid your support system is. I am eternally grateful for mine.

## Non-negotiables that help me stay sane

### Treat yourself (dis)proportionally

Usually, the way a reward system works is by assessing the "magnitude" of an accomplishment and choose a reward of a proportionate magnitude. Now, what happens when your milestones are measured by completely distorted metrics? When progress comes in tiny, invisible steps that don’t map cleanly onto anything you can quantify?

 I recently got a piece of advice — I wish I could remember who said it (and if you’re reading this, please let me know so I can give you credit). They told me something along these lines:

> “You are doing something incredibly hard. Treat yourself (dis)proportionally.” 

Meaning: don’t wait to “deserve” a reward, because in your skewed PhD-student mindset, you may never think you’ve earned it. Go for a walk. Buy yourself something small and nice. Eat real food. Allow comfort. Treat those rewards not as luxuries, but as investments in your well-being and endurance.
It’s much easier to work all day if you’re sitting in a comfortable chair instead of whatever bargain you dragged home from Facebook Marketplace. And this isn’t really about money. It’s about using whatever resources you have to afford yourself the two things that matter most: time and sanity.
Those resources include rest, too. I heard a great line recently:

> “Choose your time to rest, because if you don’t, your body will choose it for you — and it will likely be at a very inconvenient time.”

Rest isn’t indulgent, it’s preventative maintenance. Because if your priority is the work, then every other potential stressor — physical discomfort, exhaustion, poor sleep, hunger, isolation — needs to be softened, minimized, or removed.

A few personal recommendations for treating yourself (that are worth every dime):
- massages
- getting one of those airline credit cards (so that you can collect miles and fly out to see your loved ones more often with less money constraints)
- sweet treat + long walk (I like to use rare sunny days in Seattle as must-days for taking a walk)
- books (cheap + easy to feel like a bigger treat than it is)
- going to the movies/theater alone (very cathartic)

### Stay active and eat well

I cannot emphasize this enough. Since I am doing a CS PhD, I've had the pleasure of meeting two types of CS students— absolute gym beasts (or extemely physically active in some way) and those who have never stepped foot into anything remotely resembling a gym. Please, try to be closer to the first group. 

I have nothing to gain from saying this, and it has nothing to do with physical appearance. But, from talking to people and experiencing it first-handedly, spending 10+ hours every day hunched over a computer screen on a crappy diet, it deteriorates a person so quietly, until one day you have a chronic back issue or nearly faint every time you stand up.

It's easy to make fun of gym bros and label their determination to physical activity supeficial. But now, when I've realized that every extreme endeavor needs a polarity to maintain balance (so you literally don't slowly die), I admire people who *make* time to move. Even if it's just one 30-minute walk a day, any kind of physical activity makes a difference. And eat well (and as healthy as you can). What's the point of a degree if you've spent those 5-ish years shortening your lifespan by practicing poor life habits. 

### Find a hobby that produces a concrete thing
This is very particular advice, but it’s been incredibly healing for me. So much of the PhD involves progress you can’t see. Because of that, I decided to find a hobby that produces a tangible output. For me, that was painting.
Even if I only paint for twenty minutes, I end up with a physical object I can hold, see, touch. Something that says: I made this. It gives me a tiny sense of completion that the PhD rarely does.
People in my lab knit, which is even more practical — you can actually wear your progress. I also write a lot, which helps me document my thoughts and gives me space to organize them, untangle them, and look back on them later. A friend got me one of those *One line a day* journals, where you document your days of a year in one-liners. That's like bare minimum writing. And, looking back at my prevalent thoughts on certain days, it's easier for me to assesss how far I've come, or what fears I was able to beat. These hobbies have been incredibly beneficial for my mental health.

WARNING: Don’t get too carried away. I’ve absolutely had moments where I seriously considered dropping out to become a painter.

### TALK TO PEOPLE!
This one is gold.
During the first few weeks, everyone in the first-year cohort acted like they had it together. We were all going to class, doing research, and trying to maintain a social life. Meanwhile, I felt completely alone. I was convinced that I was the only one barely keeping up with my coursework, googling every other term in the lecture notes, and being *this* close to my advisors giving up on me (despite them giving no such indication).
Luckily, I’m a big talker. I started talking about my struggles out loud — then, others followed.
Once someone breaks the ice, others are relieved to admit they feel the same. My friends and I quickly realized we were dealing with nearly identical fears.

Talking to people also gives you something precious: perspective. Hearing “oh my god, me too” from the very people you compare yourself to is grounding. It humanizes everyone, including yourself.
If no one is breaking the ice, be the one who does. It's terrifying, trust me, I know. But the comfort I found in knowing that people I idolized also struggle and seek that same comfort helped me not get paralyzed by the fear of failure and drop out within the first month.

Finally, talking to the senior students in the program helped me think more about longevity — some of the people shared stories with me about *not* taking care of themselves properly and bearing physical consequences of it. Others have talked about how important it was for them to find a good therapist. I've gained a lot of insight into how to strategize my own endurance from talking to these people. Better learn from others' experience, even if it doesn't exactly match your own.

### Bonus advice: Get off social media

I'll keep this one brief. There's two reasons why I think it's essential to stay off social media as much as possible during a PhD (and longer, if you can afford to do it). 

- The endless scrolling is completely useless and does your brain a huge disservice, especially when the whole point of your degree is to be capable of doing prolonged deep thinking on a day-to-day basis. Shortening your attention span won't do you any favors — you're losing time AND mind clarity.

- Presently, social media is extremely weaponised to manipulate intellect and emotional state. Good and bad stuff happens in the world — you can read the news for that. What you *don't* want to see is 150 different reactions from different people to that same news story. You're being a direct victim of fear mongering, you're spiking your (already difficult to regulate) daily anxiety levels, and you're letting random people on the internet abuse your intellect (by feeding you what's mostly slop) and your emotional state (by keeping you in the constant state of anxiety, sometimes over opinion posts that are designed for engagement farming and rage bait). No need for FOMO — if you needed to know, it would've found its way to reach you.

If you can't completely stay off, don't keep the apps on your phone — access what you need from your computer browser and limit it to a time that's NOT before bed. This tip helped me so much in my emotional regulation and in fostering direct connections with people around me. Once you realize that most of your reality is right in front of you, it's much easier to focus on doing hard things and not fall apart emotionally.


## Moving forward

I honestly don't know if any of this will apply a year from now. I can assume that some of it won't, that I'll mature and deal with problems differently. Heck, I might not even be in a PhD program, maybe for no other reason than just... life happens. But, from my experience and talking to people, I realized most of us deal with a similar set of haunting thoughts in the first few months, and if this advice can help, then I'd rather have it out there. 

It’s hard to give advice retroactively. We forget. We rewrite our memories to match who we are now. That’s why capturing everything *as it is now* feels important to me. There’s one more thing I want to make clear, in case it didn’t come across through all the messy parts of this post:

> PhD is geninely fun and fulfilling for me. I *enjoy* the process of discovering more about myself, and I embrace whatever comes. Life isn't about everything being easy and pretty, and the longterm reward of knowing myself better, pushing the boundaries of my own thinking, and being skillful at self-regulation, are all what makes the PhD *process* worth it for me, even if I don't walk out with a degree in my hands.

This post focused in on the more difficult patterns because they can get very loud, and often the most universal. But those patterns exist to teach us something, only if we’re willing to face them with honesty and courage.
I hope my words bring even a small amount of clarity or comfort to your own journey, whoever you are and whatever you’re doing.

*Good luck!*
